# slashSuicide
slashSuicide is a simple Spigot suicide plugin which requires no configuration to set up. 
This plugin is a replacement for [EssentialX](https://essentialsx.net/) suicide,
and is useful if you don't want to install [EssentialX](https://essentialsx.net/) on your server.

## Compatibility
This plugin is currently compatible with Minecraft 1.17, however,
other versions that use the same Spigot API should _technically_ work.
I will soon test out the plugin in different Minecraft Versions and list
the versions slashSuicide is compatible with.

## Installation
Download the plugin from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/slashSuicide/releases).
Make sure to select the compatible version. If you cannot find a compatible version,
read the [Support Section](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/slashSuicide#support).
Make sure to read the [Notes](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/LightFly#note) before installation.


Installation of the plugin is straight forward and is similar to rest of the
other plugins. Simply drag and drop the appropriate version of
`.jar` file into your server's `plugin` folder.
No configuration required, and the plugin will not create a folder or
any sort of configuration files such as `config.yml`.

You will need at least [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html) or above to run this plugin, otherwise it may cause errors.
This plugin is written in [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html).

## Permissions
- `slashsuicide.suicide` allows user to run /suicide.

## Support
If you come across a bug or an unexpected behavior, please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/XyroPhyte/slashSuicide/issues)
or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MmqXcebnxC) and let me know about it. Please make sure
to include how to reproduce the bug or the issue.

Also, if you want me to make minor modifications for you, such as making the plugin for other Minecraft Versions such as 1.12.2,
feel free to let me know by joining  the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MmqXcebnxC).
I will try my best to compile a custom `.jar` for you.  I will also provide you the source code if you want.

## Aliases
To add aliases, such as /kill, simply edit the `commands.yml` file generated by your server.
For more information on `commands.yml` and setting aliases, please read this [Article](https://bukkit.fandom.com/wiki/Commands.yml).

### Note
Also, this repository's code is made for the Spigot API Minecraft 1.17. Other versions may be compatible too, but not
all. I will soon test out the `1.17 jar` with other versions of Minecraft and update here what versions the `1.17 jar` is
compatible with!

If you liked my plugin, please make sure to star my repository, as it will
help other people discover my plugin, and I'd really appreciate it!
